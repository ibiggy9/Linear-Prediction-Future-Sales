# Sales Prediction and Principle Component Analysis
Injesting Nielsen datasets, this application has two main functions: 
1) It can predict sales for a given product based on historical sales performance in addition to other potentially predictive factors such as: 
    - Average distribution % 
    - % of time on temporary discount
    - % of stores the product is on display
    - Velocity per point of distribution 

And many more.

2) In addition to providing a sales prediction, this application also will show the user which factors drive sales the most. This is incredibly variable by product.
